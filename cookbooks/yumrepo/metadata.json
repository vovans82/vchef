It probably will\nnot work with RHEL 4 or CentOS 4, especially if you have not\ntaken action to manually install yum on that platform.\n\n## Notes\n-----\n\nRHEL 6 support is fairly well tested in the dell, vmware-tools, and\nepel recipes.  Let me know if you find a platform 6 bug, related to\nany one of the recipes.\n\nThe yumrepo::dell recipe requires Dell manufactured hardware.  This\nrecipe should automatically disable itself if non-Dell hardware is\ndetected by Ohai\n\nA **breaking change in this cookbook is the introduction of an upgrade\nrecipe** for vmware-tools.  Since VMWare does not support upgrades\non their packaged vmware-tools, I created a vmware-tools-upgrade\nrecipe to migrate from vmware-tools 4.1 to 5.0u1.  You should\nensure the yumrepo recipes are not in a base role, until all your nodes\nhave been migrated to 5.0u1.  Due to this incompatibility, vmware-tools\nhas been removed from the default recipe.  If you still need vmware-tools\nfor ESX 4.1, use the previous version of this cookbook 0.15.4.\n\nThe yumrepo::vmware-tools recipe requires a VMWare Virtual Machine.\nThis recipe should automatically disable itself if non-VMWare hardware\nis detected by Ohai.\n\n## Individual Recipe Usage:\n\n### yumrepo::default\n\nIncludes recipes:\n\n* yum::yum\n* epel\n* dell\n\n### yumrepo::epel\n\n- Provides RPM keys and repo file for\n   Fedora EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)\n  * See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL for more info\n\n### yumrepo::dell\n\n- Provides repo files for the following Dell repositories.\n  - hardware / Open Manage Server Administrator\n  - community / formerly the software repository\n  - firmware / Convenient but unsupported by Dell\n  * See http://linux.dell.com for more info\n\n- repo[:dell][:download_firmware] = true||false\n  * disables/enables community/firmware repositories in dell recipe\n  * OMSA (hardware) repository will detect Dell hardware platform and\n    enable itself, dynamically. It is not affected by this attribute.\n\n### yumrepo::rbel\n\n- Provides repo files for rbel.frameos.org\n  * Ruby and Opscode Chef packages for RHEL distros \n\n### yumrepo::vmware-tools-upgrade\n\n- Removes vmware-tools for ESX 4.1 installed with this cookbook.\n  Then includes the yumrepo::vmware-tools recipe to re-install\n  VMWare Tools compatiblie with ESX 5.0u1.  *This must be in\n  your run list before the yumrepo::vmware-tools recipe* to\n  successfully upgrade the tools with the recipe.\n\n### yumrepo::vmware-tools\n\n- Uninstalls VMwareTools rpm installed from the\n   VMware ESX \"Install/Upgrade VMware Tools\" menu\n- Uninstalls manually installed vmware-tools\n   packages, the recipe needs to first run\n   vmware-uninstall-tools.pl to use the RPM packages\n   from the repo.\n- Provides RPM keys and repo file for\n   VMware Tools for the ESX 4.1 release\n  * See http://packages.vmware.com for more info\n\n#### Attributes\n\n- repo[:vmware][:release] (ESX version number, default 5.0u1)\n  * This is used to determine the correct URL in the\n    VMware RHEL5/CentOS repository.\n\n### yumrepo::annvix\n\n- Annvix repository for packages usable with Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n  and CentOS.\n  * See http://annvix.org for more information.\n\n### yumrepo::postgresql9\n\n- PostgreSQL 9.0 RPMs\n  * See http://pgrpms.org for more information.\n\n### yumrepo::zenoss\n\n- ZenOss Network Monitoring System\n  * See http://zenoss.org for more information\n\n### yumrepo::corporate\n\n- Generic example recipe to be used with an internal Yum mirror, or\n  repository.\n  * By default this recipe uses the basename of your domain as the\n    repository name.\n\n### yumrepo::jenkins\n\n- Jenkins CI yum repository\n\n## License and Author\n\nAuthor:: Eric G.
